### Description üìù

Start shopping for beautiful elegant jewelry with a modern touch. Users will be navigated to a sign up page where they can start to browse the collection of products the website offers. Users can add and update the items in their cart and checkout once they've choose all of their items. On the checkout page you will be prompted to add your shipping address and your order is complete. 

As an admin user you will be able to add products to the collection on the homepage as well as delete products. On the admin page it will show the admin all of the current active orders.
