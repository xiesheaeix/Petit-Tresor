### Description 📝

  This web app is all about expressing your feelings and sharing with others! Viewing others posts is as easy as navigating to the **post** section in the nav bar. Once there you can look around but will need to sign up with Google Oauth to leave comments or navigate to a persons specific profile. If you choose to sign up you will be able to start creating your own posts, leaving comments on other posts and even create secret posts. 🤫 Your free to express whatever is on your mind and read others expressions!
